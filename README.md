# Book Review Website

Project made for the course CS50 - Web Programming with Python and Javascript

In this Web App, it's possible to search for books, leave reviews, read reviews from other users and view the average rate of the book. This last one is pulled from a broader audience, via a third-party APi by Goodreads, another book review website. Users are able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the websiteâ€™s API.
